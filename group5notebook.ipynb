        "\n",
        "  Government gazettes contain a large volume of official documents such as court judgments, public notices, tenders, and appointments. These entries are published in unstructured or semi-structured formats, making it difficult for users—such as government officials, researchers, lawyers, and the public—to quickly find and understand relevant information.\n",

        "1.2 **Business Objective:**\n",
        "\n",
        "  .Develop an automated system that classifies gazette entries into predefined categories (e.g., Judgments, Tenders, Appointments, Public Notices).\n",
        "\n",
        "  .Reduce the time and effort needed to manually sort and search gazette entries.\n",

        "  The classification model should achieve at least 80% accuracy on a held-out test set.\n",
